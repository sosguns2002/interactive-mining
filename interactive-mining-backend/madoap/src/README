First edit settings.py to set the web server port and the paths of madis and DB.

To start the stats server use:

python madserver.py

You'll find a service script (put it into /etc/init.d), for starting and stopping
the stats server. The script maps port 80->8080 (comment the iptables rules out if you don't
want the mapping), and starts the service without giving it root credentials.
